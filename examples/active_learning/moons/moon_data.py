    Generate the classic two-moon dataset, repurposed for a minimal
    active learning example.

    This class implements the `DataPool` protocol by subclassing
    ``Dataset``, which provides all the methods except for ``append``,
    which we implement here.

    The intuition is to have one of the moons be data poor, and a quasi-
    intelligent query strategy will help overcome class imbalance to
    some extent, as it will hopefully have higher uncertainty in its
    classifier output to reflect this.

    Attributes
    ----------
    initial_samples: float
        The initial number of samples to hold out for training.
    total_samples: int
        The total number of samples to generate.
    train_indices: torch.LongTensor | None
        The indices of the samples to use for training.
    X_values: torch.Tensor
        The full set of input features; i.e. the coordinates
        of a point in 2D space.
    y_values: torch.Tensor
        The target labels; 0 for the outer moon, 1 for the inner moon.
    sigma: float
        The standard deviation of the noise to add to the coordinates.
