"""
Minimal example to show how the active learning workflow can be put together,
comprising the minimum of model training, and running some query strategy
to select data samples for labeling.

This example implements a simple MLP that takes in 2D coordinates and
outputs logits for a binary classification task. The active learning
workflow here uses a query strategy that looks for samples that have
the highest classification uncertainty (i.e. closest to 0.5), and iterates
by adding those samples to the training set. Ideally, if uncertainty is
well-adjusted to this problem, then the query strategy will select samples
that are more likely to improve the model's general performance, as compared
to a random selection baseline.

    Configure an end-to-end active learning workflow.

    The code below primarily demonstrates how to compose things together
    to form the full workflow. There are three configurations structures
    that ultimately dictate the behavior of ``Driver``, which orchestrates
    the workflow:

    1. ``TrainingConfig``: everything to do with the model training process.
    2. ``StrategiesConfig``: comprises the query, label, and metrology strategies.
    3. ``DriverConfig``: decides things like batch size, logging, and ``DistributedManager``.

    The workflow should completely quickly: an `active_learning_logs` folder will
    be created, and within it, run-specific logs. You will find the model weights,
    alongside JSON logs of the process and from the ``F1Metrology`` strategy, which
    will records how precision/recall progresses as more data points are added to the
    strategy.
